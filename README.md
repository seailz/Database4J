This project was originally devleoped as part of https://www.github.com/negative-games/framework - however I decided to adapt it slightly and make it's own repository where I will develop newer features, and allows it to function standalone, to be used with a discord bot, a REST application etc.

If you want the latest features, I recommend you use this project but eventually features from here will be added into the Framework anyway.
